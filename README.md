## This is a repository which store everyday's bing background I collected
- The background of bing is always very beautiful, I have been collecting it for a long time, and always use it as wallpaper, lock-screen-wallpaper and so on.
- So I established this repoistory, and I hooked it in my home page, I hope this repoistory will make some sense.
- and [this](https://sirius1242.github.io/bing-wallpaper-collect/) is the list of these wallpapers, all pictures in the repo will be displayed
- [curl.sh](./curl.sh) is the auto-pull script I use now, changed from [this](https://github.com/sirius1242/script/blob/master/curl.sh), mainly modification is the command "notify-send" changed to "mail" (mail need to configure first), and add git part (this script need to execute in absolute path).
- [thumbnails.sh](./thumbnails.sh) is the thumbnails auto-generator, it will compare your assets folder and thumbnails target folder and resize source file to 10% and put into directory named with date under target folder, then you can easily put the thumbnail of newly-added photo into your thumbnail site and auto cite it in index.html. You can change the folder locations if you want to use it (don't forget to move the images into main folder after you send them to your site).
